"@type": "Answer",
"text": "There are dozens of different ways to value a business, and the resulting range can be quite wide. Our approach is to mimic the way the banks place a value on the business, because banks are often financing as much as 80% or 90% of the overall transaction. In other words, if it doesn&rsquo;t pass the bank, the deal doesn&rsquo;t get done. Banking approaches to business valuation consider cashflow and debt service coverage ratios. We have found conforming with these extremely well established (many decades) banking rules leads to a valuation that works for buyers and sellers, in that the transactions get done. No bank = no deal."

<div class="collapse" id="collapse1" aria-labelledby="heading1" data-parent="#faqAccordion">
<div class="card-body"><p>There are dozens of different ways to value a business, and the resulting range can be quite wide. Our approach is to mimic the way the banks place a value on the business, because banks are often financing as much as 80% or 90% of the overall transaction. In other words, if it doesn&rsquo;t pass the bank, the deal doesn&rsquo;t get done. Banking approaches to business valuation consider cashflow and debt service coverage ratios. We have found conforming with these extremely well established (many decades) banking rules leads to a valuation that works for buyers and sellers, in that the transactions get done. No bank = no deal.</p>
